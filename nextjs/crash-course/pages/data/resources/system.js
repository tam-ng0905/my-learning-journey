		description:
			"A traditional system or central A/C system includes an outdoor condensing unit connected to an indoor coil which is responsible for cooling an indoor space. The A/C system is typically paired with an indoor gas furnace. The gas furnace provides heat and contains a fan to push air throughout the indoor space via ducts.",

		title: "What is a Ductless Split System",
		description:
			"A ductless split system typically consists of a single outdoor unit with multiple indoor units connected to it via a refrigerant line. Each room that requires cooling (or heating) will need its own indoor unit. Indoor units can come in a variety of styles, including wall-mounted and ceiling-concealed. A ductless split system is most commonly ordered as a heat pump design â€“ electric cooling and electric heating. However, a ductless split system can be ordered as cooling-only also.",

		description:
			"A swamp cooler, or evaporative cooler, is a single packaged unit using an evaporative media as its cooling mechanism instead of a compressed refrigerant system.
