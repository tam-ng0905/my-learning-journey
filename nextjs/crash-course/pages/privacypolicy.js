					<p className="mb-6">
						We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through
						our compliance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy
						describes the types of information we may collect from you or that
						you may provide (“Personal Information”) on the tarclone.com website
						(“Website”), “Tarclone” mobile application (“Mobile Application”),
						and any of their related products and services (collectively,
						“Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining,
						protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also
						describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your
						Personal Information and how you can access and update it.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”,
						“you” or “your”) and Tarclone Inc. (“Tarclone Inc.”, “we”, “us” or
						“our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a
						business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
						authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the
						terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do
						not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of
						this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not
						access and use the Services. By accessing and using the Services,
						you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be
						bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the
						practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to
						individuals that we do not employ or manage.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Automatic Collection of Data</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						When you open the Website or use the Mobile Application, our servers
						automatically record information that your browser or device sends.
						This data may include information such as your device’s IP address
						and location, browser and device name and version, operating system
						type and version, language preferences, the webpage you were
						visiting before you came to the Services, pages of the Services that
						you visit, the time spent on those pages, the information you search
						for on the Services, access times and dates, and other statistics.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Information collected automatically is used only to identify
						potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information
						regarding the usage and traffic of the Services. This statistical
						information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would
						identify any particular User of the system.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Collection of Personal Information</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are
						or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as
						a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use
						some of the features offered on the Services, you may be asked to
						provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and
						e-mail address).
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us
						when you create an account, publish content, make a purchase, or
						fill any forms on the Services. When required, this information may
						include the following:
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						• Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)
						• Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc) •
						Basic personal information (such as name, country of residence, etc)
						• Payment information (such as credit card details, bank details,
						etc) • Geolocation data of your device (such as latitude and
						longitude) • Any other materials you willingly submit to us (such as
						articles, images, feedback,
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
						then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features
						on the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is
						mandatory are welcome to contact us.
					</p>
					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Privacy of Children</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children
						under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not
						submit any Personal Information through the Services. If you have
						reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided
						Personal Information to us through the Services, please contact us
						to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our
						Services.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
						Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
						children never to provide Personal Information through the Services
						without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal
						guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary
						precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never
						give out Personal Information when online without their permission.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">
						Use and Processing of Collected Information
					</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling
						Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing
						agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller
						and we would be the data processor.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation
						involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data
						controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that
						is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Services. In such
						instances, we are a data controller because we determine the
						purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you
						submit Personal Information through the Services. We do not own,
						control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information,
						and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with
						your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal
						Information acts as a data controller.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal
						obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
						Information. If you do not provide the information that we request,
						we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or
						services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
						the following purposes:
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						• Create and manage user accounts • Fulfill and manage orders •
						Deliver products or services • Improve products and services • Send
						administrative information • Send marketing and promotional
						communications • Send product and service updates • Respond to
						inquiries and offer support • Request user feedback • Improve user
						experience • Post customer testimonials • Deliver targeted
						advertising • Enforce terms and conditions and policies • Protect
						from abuse and malicious users • Respond to legal requests and
						prevent harm • Run and operate the Services
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact
						with the Services, where you are located in the world and if one of
						the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
						more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary
						for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
						pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary
						for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject;
						(iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
						public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
						us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
						interests pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or
						aggregate some of your Personal Information in order to better serve
						you and to improve and update our Services.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
						information until you object to such processing by opting out,
						without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases.
						In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis
						that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
						provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
						requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Payment Processing</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your
						credit card details or other payment account information, which will
						be used solely for processing payments. We use third-party payment
						processors (“Payment Processors”) to assist us in processing your
						payment information securely.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as
						managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
						effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
						Discover. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL
						secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with
						digital signatures, and the Services are also in compliance with
						strict vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an
						environment as possible for Users. We will share payment data with
						the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes
						of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing
						with complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal
						Information from you, which allows them to process your payments
						(e.g., your email address, address, credit card details, and bank
						account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process
						through their systems, including data collection and data
						processing. Where necessary for processing future or recurring
						payments and subject to your prior consent, your financial
						information will be stored in encrypted form on secure servers of
						our Payment Processors. The Payment Processors’ use of your Personal
						Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which
						may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this
						Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy
						policies.
					</p>
					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Managing Information</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about
						you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the
						Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we
						may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our
						records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to
						our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.
						If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently
						delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.
					</p>
					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Disclosure of Information</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
						transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share
						your information with our trusted subsidiaries and joint venture
						partners, affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers
						(collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the
						operation of the Services available to you and whose privacy
						policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our
						policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any
						information with unaffiliated third parties.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your
						information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or
						comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the
						information they need only in order to perform their designated
						functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of
						the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.
						We will share and disclose your information only with the following
						categories of Service Providers:
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						• Cloud computing services • Communication and collaboration
						services • Data analytics services • Data storage services •
						Financial services • Order fulfillment services • Payment processors
						• Performance monitoring services • Product engineering and design
						services • Sales and marketing services • Social networks • User
						authentication services • Website hosting service providers
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or
						receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a
						subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith
						that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your
						safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
						government request.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger
						or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of
						its assets, your user account, and your Personal Information will
						likely be among the assets transferred.
					</p>
					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Retention of Information</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
						necessary to comply with our legal obligations, as long as your user
						account remains active, until the purchase order or Services are
						fulfilled, until our and our affiliates and partners obligations are
						fulfilled, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a
						longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
						Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a
						manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
						expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right
						to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the
						right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of
						the retention period.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Cookies</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Our Services use “cookies” to help personalize your online
						experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk
						by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
						deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
						you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
						the cookie to you. Click here to learn more about cookies and how
						they work.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for
						security and personalization, and for statistical purposes. Please
						note that you have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most
						web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can
						modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Data Analytics</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Our Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies,
						web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to
						collect standard internet activity and usage information. The
						information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User
						activity such as how often Users visit our Services, what pages they
						visit and for how long, etc. We use the information obtained from
						these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our
						Services.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Do Not Track Signals</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
						websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
						tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
						in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
						collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who
						use or visit a website or online service as they move across
						different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not
						Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Services are not
						yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals
						communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail
						throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your
						Personal Information.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Advertisements</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We may permit certain third-party companies to help us tailor
						advertising that we think may be of interest to Users and to collect
						and use other data about User activities on the Services. These
						companies may deliver ads that might place cookies and otherwise
						track User behavior.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Social Media Features</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook
						and Twitter buttons, Share This buttons, etc (collectively, “Social
						Media Features”). These Social Media Features may collect your IP
						address, what page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a
						cookie to enable Social Media Features to function properly. Social
						Media Features are hosted either by their respective providers or
						directly on our Services. Your interactions with these Social Media
						Features are governed by the privacy policy of their respective
						providers.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Email Marketing</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily
						subscribe at any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail
						address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any
						third parties except as allowed in the information use and
						processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third-party
						provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent
						via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
					</p>

					<p className="mb-6">
						In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will
						clearly state who the e-mail is from and provide clear information
						on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop receiving our
						newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe
						instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However,
						you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Push Notifications</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We offer push notifications to which you may also voluntarily
						subscribe at any time. To make sure push notifications reach the
						correct devices, we use a third-party push notifications provider
						who relies on a device token unique to your device which is issued
						by the operating system of your device. While it is possible to
						access a list of device tokens, they will not reveal your identity,
						your unique device ID, or your contact information to us or our
						third-party push notifications provider. We will maintain the
						information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and
						regulations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push
						notifications, simply adjust your device settings accordingly.
					</p>
					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Link to Other Resources</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or
						controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for
						the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
						encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read
						the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect
						Personal Information.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Information Security</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We secure information you provide on computer servers in a
						controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access,
						use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative,
						technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against
						unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal
						Information in our control and custody. However, no data
						transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be
						guaranteed.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
						acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of
						the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security,
						integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged
						between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any
						such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit
						by a third party, despite best efforts.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the
						security of the device you use to communicate with us and the
						security you use to protect your credentials, please take
						appropriate measures to protect this information.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Data Breach</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						In the event we become aware that the security of the Services has
						been compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed
						to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
						including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve
						the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but
						not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification
						to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of
						a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
						individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to
						the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise
						required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Change and Amendments</h2>
					<p className="mb-6">
						We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to
						the Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will
						revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also
						provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as
						through the contact information you have provided.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-6">
						An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon
						the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your
						continued use of the Services after the effective date of the
						revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will
						constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not,
						without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner
						materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal
						Information was collected.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-bold my-2">Acceptance of This Policy</h2>

						terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Services and
